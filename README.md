# `kubectl grid`

A kubectl plugin to create test clusters and manage test runs on the clusters.

## Questions

**Why not Terraform/Pulumi?**  

Great question. We love all of the mature automation tools that can spin up production-grade, best-practices, rock-solid infrastructure. But a test grid isn't production grade. We wanted to focused on test grid execution speed instea of building production-grade clusters. So, keep using Terraform and other tools to manage your prod cluster, this project is NOT what you want there.
